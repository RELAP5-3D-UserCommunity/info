# Getting access to RELAP5-3D

The licensing and use of RELAP5-3D is comprised of two separate steps. Licensing
occurs first and is accomplished via licensing agreement discussions between the
 organization requesting a RELAP5-3D license and the INL Technology Deployment
 office. The principal contact from the Technology Deployment office is the
 Agreements Administrator. This individual can explain the licensing process,
 answer questions, and provides details on required additional information. An
 organization interested in obtaining a RELAP5-3D license makes their request
 via the INL Nuclear Computational Resource Center (NCRC) website
 ( [https://inl.gov/ncrc/](https://inl.gov/ncrc/) ).
